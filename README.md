### Hi there, I'm Jason! ðŸ‘‹


I'm a full-time Software Engineer with a background in Biomedical Engineering and Computer Science. I'm working on a masters in CS and working full-time, so my free-time might not be as plentiful as I'd hope but I certainly spend most of it coding! My current main OSS project is https://github.com/Sequel-Ace/Sequel-Ace, which I lead after forking the longtime tool Sequel Pro.

I love to work on iOS apps and macOS projects on my free-time. During the day, I do most of my development in Laravel (which is awesome, by the way)! While my favorite language is probably Swift, Python and PHP both hold special places in my heart.
