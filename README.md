### Hey there, I'm Jason! ðŸ‘‹


I'm a full-time Software Engineer with a background in Biomedical Engineering and Computer Science. I earned a Bachelor's Degree in Biomedical Engineering with High Honors from Georgia Tech in 2018, and I completed a Masters in CS online through Georgia Tech's Online Masters in CS program in 2021. My current main OSS project is [Sequel Ace](https://github.com/Sequel-Ace/Sequel-Ace), which I lead after forking the longtime tool Sequel Pro. While my free-time might be little, I love spending what little time I have making music and tinkering with code.

During the day, I do most of my development in Laravel (which is awesome, by the way)! Outside of work, I love to work on iOS apps and macOS projects. While my favorite language is probably Swift, Python and PHP both hold special places in my heart.
